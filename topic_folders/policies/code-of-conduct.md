### The Carpentries Code of Conduct

#### Code of Conduct (Summary View)

Below is a summary of The Carpentries Code of Conduct. Continue reading for a [more detailed description of the CoC](#code-of-conduct-detailed-view); [Incident Response Guidelines for Community Members](#incident-response-guidelines); [Incident Reporting Guidelines](#incident-reporting-guidelines); [Incident Response Procedure for the Code of Conduct Committee](#incident-response-procedure-and-enforcement-guidelines); and the [Termed Suspension Checklist](#termed-suspension-guidelines).

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by The Carpentries' Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form or behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee by emailing coc@carpentries.org who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.

#### Code of Conduct (Detailed View)

Part 1. Introduction 

The Carpentries is a community-led project. We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Carpentry activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by The Carpentries including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.  

The Carpentry [Code of Conduct Committee](https://carpentries.org/coc-ctte/) is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. It can be contacted by emailing [coc@carpentries.org](mailto:coc@carpentries.org). 
All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential. 
 
Part 2. The Carpentries Code of Conduct

The Carpentries is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level. 

Everyone who participates in Carpentries activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by The Carpentries including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the Carpentries resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information. 

Part 2.1 Expected behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all Carpentries events and platforms:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any Carpentries event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group  
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation  
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images  
- unwelcome sexual attention  
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact  
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs  
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm  
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop  
- publication of private communication without consent  

Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any Carpentry events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage the Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

#### Incident Response Guidelines for Community Members

Information on how to report a Code of Conduct (CoC) incident is outlined in our [Code of Conduct Incident Reporting Guidelines](#incident-reporting-guidelines).

The checklists below outline the steps any community member (workshop host, [instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/), helper, etc.) can take during a potential Code of Conduct incident __before__ reporting it to the Code of Conduct Committee. You may encounter challenging situations and have limited experience or training to feel comfortable enforcing the CoC. These guidelines are meant to help guide you through the process of supporting other community members and yourself during an incident. 

All Carpentries community members should feel empowered to enforce the Code of Conduct. 

Ideally we would all be able to diffuse an incident. In practice, we have varying comfort with situations depending on our current experience and the environment. Below are ways that you can be supportive, and steps that you can take during or after an incident.

If you can, move from being a bystander to being a Code of Conduct first responder. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening, but feel someone should, please submit a report, in person to a workshop host or instructor, or via the [Code of Conduct incident report form][reporting-form] to the Code of Conduct committee.

##### Immediate Response 

The initial response to an incident is very important and will set the tone for The Carpentries community. Depending on the severity and/or details of the incident, an immediate response may be required. If an incident involves physical danger, or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any member of the community may -- and should -- act immediately to protect safety. This can include contacting emergency or crisis resources.  

##### Ongoing Incidents

If an incident is ongoing, whether in-person or online, any community member (workshop host, instructor, helper) may act immediately and employ any of the tools available to the community member to pacify the situation. In situations where an individual community member acts immediately, they must inform the workshop host as soon as possible, and report their actions to the Code of Conduct Committee for review within 24 hours of the incident. Should there be a need for an immediate response, please see the [Immediate Response Checklist](#immediate-response).

##### Checklists for Responding to an Incident

**Immediate Response Checklist**
* Assess whether you need a first-responder (law enforcement, etc.) to immediately respond to the incident. If so, ask the reporter to stay with you and dial the appropriate emergency response number.
* If there is any general threat to participants and/or the safety of anyone attending a Carpentries event, contact the emergency response number established.
* If individuals are physically safe, contact law enforcement or security only at the reporter’s request.
* Follow any local guidelines for handling incidents, including if you have a legal reporting role. 

**In-Person Event Checklist (Carpentries Workshops, CarpentryCon, CarpentryConnect, Carpentries Instructor Training)**
* Ensure participants are safe.
* If not refer to the [Immediate Response Checklist](#immediate-response).
* Listen to the reporter and write down as many details as possible.
* Ask the reporter to report the incident via the [Code of Conduct Incident Report Form][reporting-form]. If they would rather you complete the report, complete the report with their assistance. 
* Inform the workshop host that there was an incident, and that a report was submitted via the [incident report form][reporting-form]. If the incident involves the workshop host, report the incident directly to the Code of Conduct committee via the incident report form. 

**Online Events and Communications Channels Checklist (Teaching Demonstrations, Community Discussions, Carpentries Instructor Training, Slack Channels, TopicBox)**
* Inform the event host/meeting facilitator that there was an issue, and send a report via the [incident report form][reporting-form]. 
* If the incident involves the event host/meeting facilitator, please complete the [incident report form][reporting-form] and rest assured that confidentiality and your experience in our community is our first priority.

If a community member has violated the CoC via an online event, the CoC committee can enact a short-term [Termed Suspension](#termed-suspension-guidelines), and the reportee’s privileges to all Carpentries communication channels could be suspended until the Code of Conduct Committee has concluded their investigation of the reported incident.

Individuals reported often get upset, defensive, or deny the report. Allow them to give any additional details about the incident. However, remember:

- It does not matter if they did not intend to hurt anyone; their behaviour still impacted participants negatively.
- It is not your job to reassure or forgive them.
- Do not allow the reported person to make an apology to the reporter or impacted person. Often an apology centers the reported person’s feelings and not the person who was impacted. You may accept their apology and offer to pass it on, but you’re not required to if you think it would negatively impact the reporter.


#### Incident Reporting Guidelines

##### Reporting a Potential Code of Conduct Incident 

If you are attending a Carpentries workshop, in-person event, or participating in one of our online events or communication channels, and believe someone is in physical danger, please ask your workshop host, instructor(s), or another community member  to contact the appropriate emergency responders (police, crisis hotline, etc.). Prior to a Carpentries workshop or in-person event, event organisers should determine emergency contact numbers and local procedures.

If you believe someone violated the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) during a Carpentries event or in a Carpentries online space, we ask that you report it. If you are not sure if the incident happened in a Carpentries governed space, we ask that you still report the incident. You are encouraged to submit your report by completing the [Code of Conduct Incident Report Form][reporting-form]. The form may be completed anonymously or you may include your contact information. 

__[Submit a Code of Conduct Incident Report][reporting-form]__

The Code of Conduct Committee takes all incident reports seriously and will review all reports according to our [Enforcement Guidelines](#incident-response-procedure-and-enforcement-guidelines).  A report guarantees review, but not necessarily that an action will be taken.

##### Alternative Contact Points

If you would prefer other ways to contact us, an email to [coc@carpentries.org](mailto:coc@carpentries.org) will be seen by all of the [Code of Conduct committee](https://carpentries.org/coc-ctte). If you are uncomfortable reporting to the Code of Conduct committee, incidents can also be reported to Cam Macdonell, the designated ombudsman for The Carpentries, at [confidential@carpentries.org](mailto:confidential@carpentries.org).  

The Carpentries Executive Director (Tracy Teal) can also be contacted by telephone at +1-530-341-3230 or email at [tkteal@carpentries.org](mailto:tkteal@carpentries.org).

##### Confidentiality

You are welcome to report an incident anonymously. If you would like someone to follow-up with you about the progress of your incident report however, you would need to provide contact information.

**All reports will be kept confidential** with details shared only with the Code of Conduct committee members. In the case that a CoC committee member is involved in a report, the member will be asked to recuse themselves from ongoing conversations and they will not have access to reports after the enforcement decision has been made. Resolution action may also include removal of that member from the CoC committee. 

In rare cases the CoC committee may suspend a community member. In such cases, the Executive Council and Carpentries Staff will be informed in order to prevent future harm to the community, and the Carpentries Staff [Immediate Response Checklist](#immediate-response) will be employed. 

Some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and though details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those concerns in your report. You are still encouraged to report the incident so that we can support you while keeping our community members safe. In some cases we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behaviour, and take action on that pattern.

The Code of Conduct committee may determine that a public statement should be made about the incident and/or the action taken. If that is the case, the identities of all reporters and reportees will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct the CoC committee otherwise. 


##### Report Data
Reports can be filed anonymously with minimal details. If you do not feel you can provide details, we would still like to be aware that an incident occurred. Our ability to act is impacted by the amount of information you can provide, however.  

Information about an incident may be communicated to relevant Carpentries personnel in cases where a community member is suspended from engaging in the Carpentries community. In those cases, the [Termed Suspension Checklist](#termed-suspension-guidelines) will be employed. 

##### Following Up with Reporter(s)

Once a report is filed through the [Code of Conduct Incident Report Form][reporting-form] or other communication channels, the Code of Conduct committee will handle the review and follow up according to the procedures in the [Enforcement Guidelines](#incident-response-procedure-and-enforcement-guidelines).

#### Incident Response Procedure and Enforcement Guidelines

This document outlines the Incident Response Procedure and Enforcement Guidelines followed by The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee (CoCc) once an incident report is received through the [incident report form][reporting-form], or other channels. These guidelines are used when the CoCc reviews and resolves incidents to ensure consistency, transparency, and fairness. The Carpentries has access to legal support through our fiscal sponsor, [Community Initiatives](https://communityin.org/), should there be a need. 

The CoC committee will attempt to ensure your safety and help with any immediate needs, particularly at in-person events. The incident reporter(s) will receive an email from the Code of Conduct committee acknowledging receipt of an incident report within 24 hours of the form submission and aims for the same response time through other channels. 

If there is an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the committee’s immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.  

The committee will make all efforts to meet within two business days to review the incident and determine next steps. Once the committee has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond. Examples of possible incident responses are outlined in the Carpentries [Enforcement Guidelines](#incident-response-procedure-and-enforcement-guidelines). The committee will respond within one week to the original reporter with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.   

Once the committee has determined its resolution, the original reporter will be contacted to let them know what action (if any) will be taken. The committee will take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of its response, but may decide not to act on that feedback.  

Finally, the Chair of the Code of Conduct Committee and Executive Council Liaison will write up a [transparency report](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/blob/master/code-of-conduct-transparency-reports/) for incidents reported through the incident report form or other channels. Names of the reporter and any persons involved in the incident will not be included unless the resolution results in a termed suspension. The Executive Council may choose to make a public report of the incident while maintaining anonymity of those involved.

##### Terminology
- **Reporter**: Person reporting an incident.
- **Reportee**: Person being reported.
- **Incident Response Group (IRG)**: Group of people who work on a specific incident. There will be a minimum of three people from the CoC committee on each IRG.
- **Incident Response Lead (IRL)**: Person on the CoC committee heading the IRG. This person is appointed on a per-incident basis by the IRG.

##### Incident Response Procedure for The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee

The following is a summary of the steps the Code of Conduct Committee takes when responding to an incident reported via the incident report form. More detailed information is also provided below the summary.

- If there is a need for an immediate response (physical danger, disruption in a workshop, ongoing online conversation) communicated through any channel, the CoCc can activate the [Termed Suspension Checklist](#termed-suspension-guidelines).
- For non-immediate responses submitted via the [incident report form][reporting-form], an auto-generated email is sent to the Code of Conduct committee that a report has been received. 
- An auto-response is sent to the reporter acknowledging that the incident report was received via the secure form. 
- The first person on the Code of Conduct committee to see the report reviews it and provides an initial response to the reporter within 24 hours of the report being submitted, or immediately if safety is an issue. 
- This response will include a timeline of what to expect as the Code of Conduct committee works to provide a resolution. 
- The first person on the Code of Conduct committee to see the report completes an [incident data collection form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKR30JXU4yE7gsJa6SDQqwhWd8rUYKehy6NyMwwx7Mw/edit?usp=sharing) to share with the CoC Committee.   
- A minimum of three members of the Code of Conduct Committee (the Incident Response Group (IRG)) meet to discuss the incident. The incident report document is shared with the IRG prior to this meeting.
- An Incident Response Lead (IRL) is appointed by the IRG.
- The IRG determines if the incident occurred in a Carpentries space and is therefore appropriate to review.
- The IRG reviews all of the information included in the incident report and determines whether more information is needed. If so, that information is requested from the reporter.
- The IRL contacts the reportee(s) to set up a meeting if necessary. At least two IRG members should be present at the meeting with the reportee(s).
- An optional meeting with the reporter takes place to obtain more information. At least two members of the IRG should be present at the meeting. 
- After further collection and review of information if needed, the IRG determines a resolution. Possible [resolutions](#resolutions) are located in this documentation and include, but are not limited to, a private reprimand, public reprimand, and termed suspension.
- The IRL updates the reporter and  solicits feedback on the resolution. Feedback may or may not be used to update the resolution. 
- The IRL updates the reportee(s).
- The Staff Liaison determines whether the [Termed Suspension Checklist](#termed-suspension-guidelines) should be employed or other actions taken.
- Essential personnel are notified to implement any actions. Report details remain confidential. 
- Decisions and outcomes are logged on the private Code of Conduct Committee GitHub repository. 
- The Chair of the Code of Conduct Committee and Executive Council Liaison write up a transparency report.

##### Report Acknowledgement

When a report is received, any one of the Code of Conduct committee members will reply to the reporter to confirm receipt. This reply will be sent within 24 hours of the incident being reported, and the CoCc will strive to respond much more quickly than that.

For details about what the incident report should contain, see the [Incident Reporting Guidelines](#incident-response-procedure-and-enforcement-guidelines). If a report does not contain enough information, the committee will attempt to obtain all relevant information to resolve the incident. The committee is empowered to act on the behalf of The Carpentries in contacting any individuals involved, unless this is not requested by the reporter. **Protecting the safety of the reporter is the priority in any incident report or review.** The committee is also empowered to act if any of its members become aware of ongoing behaviour that, taken as a whole over a long time period, is inappropriate. 

##### Incident Response Assessment

Upon receiving a report of an incident at least three members of the CoCc will form the Incident Response Group (IRG). The IRG will meet to:  

- Assign an Incident Response Lead (IRL).
- Review report documentation to determine the content and context of the incident.
- Consult documentation of past incidents for patterns of behaviour (if available and applicable).
- Discuss appropriate resolutions to the incident.
- Determine the follow up actions for the reportee, reporter and anyone else named in the report who may have been impacted.
 
The deliberations of the incident response assessment will be stored in the Code of Conduct Committe’s private GitHub repository.

The committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week of receipt of the incident response form. In the event that a resolution cannot be determined in that time, the IRL will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.  

##### Following up with the Reportee

When following up with the reportee, the CoCc representatives will:

- Explain that an incident was reported that involves the reportee.
- In this explanation, the focus will be on the impact of their behaviour, not their intent.
- Reiterate the Code of Conduct and that their behaviour was deemed inappropriate.
- Provide concrete examples of how they can improve their behaviour.
- Give them the opportunity to state their view of the incident.
- Remind them of the consequences of their behaviour, or future consequences if the behaviour is repeated.
- Explain the possible resolutions that may be enforced should the CoCc determine there is a breach.

##### Resolutions

The committee must agree on a resolution by the majority of all members investigating the incident in question. If the committee cannot reach a majority decision and deadlocks for over one week, they will turn the matter over to the Executive Council for resolution.  

What follows are examples of possible resolutions to an incident report. This list is not comprehensive, and The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary to resolve an incident. Possible resolutions to an incident include:

- Nothing, if the Code of Conduct committee determined there was no breach in the Code of Conduct. 
- A private verbal reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. 
- This conversation may happen in person, over video conference call, or by phone.
- The IRL will write a short report of the conversation to be shared with the reportee for verification purposes and then shared with the CoCc and maintained on record in the private GitHub repository.
- A private emailed reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. 
- The IRL will deliver a reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing the Code of Conduct Committee.
- Requiring that the reportee avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, another person for the remainder of the Carpentries event.
- Refusal of alcoholic beverage purchases by the reportee at Carpentries events.
- Ending a talk that violates the Code of Conduct early.
- Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the Code of Conduct.
- Not allowing a speaker who violated the Code of Conduct to give (further) talks at Carpentries workshops or events now or in the future.
- Requiring that the reportee not volunteer for future Carpentries events either indefinitely or for a certain time period determined by the CoCc.
- Requiring that the reportee refund any travel grant funding they received.
- Requiring that the reportee immediately leave an event and not return.
- Immediately ending any volunteer responsibilities and privileges the reportee holds.  
- A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. on the listserv for a listserv violation; GitHub for a GitHub violation, etc.). 
- The CoCc may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.  
- An imposed suspension (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a listserv or the Carpentries’ GitHub repos). 
- The IRL will communicate this suspension to the reportee. They will be asked to take this suspension voluntarily, but if they do not agree, then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this suspension.  
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Carpentries spaces (listservs, GitHub, in-person events including workshops, etc). 
- The CoC committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new Carpentries communication forums, or otherwise maintained.  
- Assistance to the complainant with a report to other bodies, for example, institutional offices or appropriate law enforcement agencies.  

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the IRL will contact the reporter and any other affected parties to explain the proposed resolution. The IRL will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the CoC committee is not required to act on this feedback. 

##### Appeal Process
Any individual(s) involved in a Code of Conduct report handled by CoC committee (CoCc) has the right to appeal a decision made by the committee. An appeal can be made directly to the CoCc (email: [coc@carpentries.org](mailto:coc@carpentries.org)) or to the ombudsperson (email: [confidential@carpentries.org](mailto:confidential@carpentries.org)) by sending an email with subject line __Code of Conduct Incident Appeal__.

The email should include documentation related to the incident to support the appeal. The said documentation may include, but does not have to be limited to:
- Information from the reportee justifying reasoning for the appeal.
- Letters of support from community members.
- Statements from other individuals involved in the incident to support the appeal.

Appeals can be requested up to 30 days after a resolution has been determined.

##### Accountability

The CoC committee will submit a report to The Carpentries Executive Council and the Carpentries Executive Director in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a termed suspension or ban.  

The CoC committee will never publicly discuss the details of an incident; any public statements will be made by The Carpentries Executive Council.  

At the end of every quarter, the Executive Council will publish an aggregated count of the incidents the Code of Conduct Committee reviewed, indicating how many reports it received, how many incidents it investigated independently, how many times it acted unilaterally, and for each of these under which part of the Code of Conduct the incident was classified.  

##### Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest (a committee member, their family member, or someone with whom the committee member has a close academic or employment relationship is involved in a complaint), the committee member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.  

In the case that a CoCc member is involved in a report, the member will be asked to recuse themselves from ongoing conversations and they will not have access to reports after the enforcement decision has been made. Resolution action may also include removal of that member from the Code of Conduct committee. 

#### Termed Suspension Guidelines

##### The Carpentries Termed Suspension Checklist

As a part of their enforcement options, The Carpentries Code of Conduct (CoC) committee can place a community member in Termed Suspension, where the community member is removed from all Carpentries engagement for a period of time.

The goal of a Termed Suspension is to 1) limit a person's participation in virtual and in-person Carpentries spaces for a set time to create a safe space for the community, and 2) to give time and opportunity for the individual to review their response to the incident and demonstrate immediate, ongoing, and demonstrable changes as evaluated by the CoC committee before possible reinstatement.

In most cases a Termed Suspension will only be enacted after an incident has been reviewed by the CoC committee and a resolution is reached. However, in severe situations, in particular where there is active harassment, the CoC committee may enact an immediate short-term Termed Suspension while an incident is under review.

If there is a decision for a Termed Suspension, the following checklist is followed by the appropriate personnel to enact the Termed Suspension. In accordance with CoC confidentiality guidelines, only essential personnel will be involved in implementation of these actions.

##### Member Organisation and Local Activities
The suspended member shall not be involved in officially branded Carpentries workshops or activities at the member or local site for the duration of the suspension. We expect the suspended member to assert that they will be able to carry out this suspension accordingly and to notify the CoC committee if this suspension will interfere with their expected employment duties. 

If the suspension does affect employment duties or the suspended member is the key contact for a member site, the member will work with The Carpentries Executive Director to determine a course of action.

##### Lesson Development and Maintenance
The suspended member will not be allowed to post PRs, issues, or comments to any repository in the carpentries, including but not limited to datacarpentry, swcarpentry, library carpentry, data-lessons, and carpentrieslab organisations.
