#### Code of Conduct (Detailed View)

1. Introduction 

The Carpentries is a community-led project. We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Carpentry activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by The Carpentries including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.  

The Carpentry [Code of Conduct Committee](https://carpentries.org/coc-ctte/) is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. It can be contacted by emailing [coc@carpentries.org](mailto:coc@carpentries.org). 
All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential. 
 

2. The Carpentries Code of Conduct

The Carpentries is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level. 

Everyone who participates in Carpentries activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by The Carpentries including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the Carpentries resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information. 

2.1 Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all Carpentries events and platforms:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

2.2 Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any Carpentries event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group  
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation  
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images  
- unwelcome sexual attention  
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact  
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs  
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm  
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop  
- publication of private communication without consent  

2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any Carpentry events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage the Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

#### Incident Repsonse Guidelines

Information on how to report a Code of Conduct (CoC) incident is outlined in our [Code of Conduct Incident Reporting Guidelines](#).

The checklists below outline the steps any community member (workshop host, [instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/), helper, etc.) can take during a potential Code of Conduct incident __before__ reporting it to the Code of Conduct Committee. You may encounter challenging situations and have limited experience or training to feel comfortable enforcing the CoC. These guidelines are meant to help guide you through the process of supporting other community members and yourself during an incident. 

All Carpentries community members should feel empowered to enforce the Code of Conduct. 

Ideally we would all be able to diffuse an incident. In practice, we have varying comfort with situations depending on our current experience and the environment. Below are ways that you can be supportive, and steps that you can take during or after an incident.

If you can, move from being a bystander to being a Code of Conduct first responder. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening, but feel someone should, please submit a report, in person to a workshop host or instructor, or via the [Code of Conduct incident report form](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2) to the Code of Conduct committee.

##### Immediate Response 

The initial response to an incident is very important and will set the tone for The Carpentries community. Depending on the severity and/or details of the incident, an immediate response may be required. If an incident involves physical danger, or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any member of the community may -- and should -- act immediately to protect safety. This can include contacting emergency or crisis resources.  

##### Ongoing Incidents

If an incident is ongoing, whether in-person or online, any community member (workshop host, instructor, helper) may act immediately and employ any of the tools available to the community member to pacify the situation. In situations where an individual community member acts immediately, they must inform the workshop host as soon as possible, and report their actions to the Code of Conduct Committee for review within 24 hours of the incident. Should there be a need for an immediate response, please see the [Immediate Response Checklist](#).

##### Checklists for Responding to an Incident

**Immediate Response Checklist**
* Assess whether you need a first-responder (law enforcement, etc.) to immediately respond to the incident. If so, ask the reporter to stay with you and dial the appropriate emergency response number.
* If there is any general threat to participants and/or the safety of anyone attending a Carpentries event, contact the emergency response number established.
* If individuals are physically safe, contact law enforcement or security only at the reporterâ€™s request.
* Follow any local guidelines for handling incidents, including if you have a legal reporting role. 

**In-Person Event Checklist (Carpentries Workshops, CarpentryCon, CarpentryConnect, Carpentries Instructor Training)**
* Ensure participants are safe.
* If not refer to the [Immediate Response Checklist]().
* Listen to the reporter and write down as many details as possible.
* Ask the reporter to report the incident via the [Code of Conduct Incident Report Form](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2). If they would rather you complete the report, complete the report with their assistance. 
* Inform the workshop host that there was an incident, and that a report was submitted via the [incident report form](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2). If the incident involves the workshop host, report the incident directly to the Code of Conduct committee via the incident report form. 

**Online Events and Communications Channels Checklist (Teaching Demonstrations, Community Discussions, Carpentries Instructor Training, Slack Channels, TopicBox)**
* Inform the event host/meeting facilitator that there was an issue, and send a report via the [incident report form](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2). 
* If the incident involves the event host/meeting facilitator, please complete the [incident report form](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2) and rest assured that confidentiality and your experience in our community is our first priority.

If a community member has violated the CoC via an online event, the CoC committee can enact a short-term [Termed Suspension](#), and the reporteeâ€™s privileges to all Carpentries communication channels could be suspended until the Code of Conduct Committee has concluded their investigation of the reported incident.

Individuals reported often get upset, defensive, or deny the report. Allow them to give any additional details about the incident. However, remember:

- It does not matter if they did not intend to hurt anyone; their behavior still impacted participants negatively.
- It is not your job to reassure or forgive them.
- Do not allow the reported person to make an apology to the reporter or impacted person. Often an apology centers the reported personâ€™s feelings and not the person who was impacted. You may accept their apology and offer to pass it on, but youâ€™re not required to if you think it would negatively impact the reporter.


#### Incident Reporting Guidelines

##### Reporting a Potential Code of Conduct Incident 

If you are attending a Carpentries workshop, in-person event, or participating in one of our online events or communication channels, and believe someone is in physical danger, please ask your workshop host, instructor(s), or another community member  to contact the appropriate emergency responders (police, crisis hotline, etc.). Prior to a Carpentries workshop or in-person event, event organisers should determine emergency contact numbers and local procedures.

If you believe someone violated the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) during a Carpentries event or in a Carpentries online space, we ask that you report it. If you are not sure if the incident happened in a Carpentries governed space, we ask that you still report the incident. You are encouraged to submit your report by completing the [Code of Conduct Incident Report Form](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2). The form may be completed anonymously or you may include your contact information. 

__[Submit a Code of Conduct Incident Report](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2)__

The Code of Conduct Committee takes all incident reports seriously and will review all reports according to our [Enforcement Guidelines](). A report guarantees review, but not necessarily that an action will be taken.

##### Alternative Contact Points

If you would prefer other ways to contact us, an email to coc@carpentries.org will be seen by all of the [Code of Conduct committee](https://carpentries.org/coc-ctte). If you are uncomfortable reporting to the Code of Conduct committee, incidents can also be reported to Cam Macdonell, the designated ombudsman for The Carpentries, at [confidential@carpentries.org](mailto:confidential@carpentries.org).  

The Carpentries Executive Director (Tracy Teal) can also be contacted by telephone at +1-530-341-3230 or email at tkteal@carpentries.org

##### Confidentiality

You are welcome to report an incident anonymously. If you would like someone to follow-up with you about the progress of your incident report however, you would need to provide contact information.


**All reports will be kept confidential** with details shared only with the Code of Conduct committee members. In the case that a CoCc member is involved in a report, the member will be asked to recuse themselves from ongoing conversations and they will not have access to reports after the enforcement decision has been made. Resolution action may also include removal of that member from the CoC committee. 

In rare cases the CoCc may suspend a community member. In such cases, the Executive Council and Carpentries Staff will be informed in order to prevent future harm to the community, and the Carpentries Staff [Immediate Response Checklist](#) will be employed. 

Some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and though details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those concerns in your report. You are still encouraged to report the incident so that we can support you while keeping our community members safe. In some cases we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

The Code of Conduct committee may determine that a public statement should be made about the incident and/or the action taken. If that is the case, the identities of all reporters and reportees will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct the CoCc otherwise. 


##### Report Data
Reports can be filed anonymously with minimal details. If you do not feel you can provide details, we would still like to be aware that an incident occurred. Our ability to act is impacted by the amount of information you can provide, however.  

Information about an incident may be communicated to relevant Carpentries personnel in cases where a community member is suspended from engaging in the Carpentries community. In those cases, the [Termed Suspension Checklist() will be employed. 

##### Following Up with Reporter(s)

Once a report is filed through the Code of Conduct Incident Report Form](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2) or other communication channels, the Code of Conduct committee will handle the review and follow up according to the  procedures in the [Enforcement Guidelines](#).
