# The Carpentries Committee Guidelines

## Context
Committees are an integral part of The Carpentries community. Establishing committee guidelines will ensure sustainability, reduce burnout, and ensure clear lines of communication and appropriate transparency for all Carpentries committees. The following guidelines are __recommendations__ to help committees establish guidelines, consistent documentation, and governance structure.

## Committee Guidelines 

To ensure sustainability, accountability and effective communication for our committees, we propose the following guidelines. Each committee should:

- Hold regular meetings (at least 4 per year)  
- Post meetings on the community calendar 
   - Meetings do not necessarily need to be public. For the Code of Conduct Committee only business meetings are public, not incident meetings.  
- Post meeting notes or minutes in a consistent location. Minutes can be public or private, depending on the committee.
- Appoint a committee chair or co-chairs, with a description of their responsibilities
- Identify a chair/co-chairs succession plan
- Identify chair, and potentially committee, term limits
- Include contact information for the committee
- Host at least one community call per year
- Provide a roles and responsibilities document for the committee 
- Provide a short description of what the committee does
- Provide a public list of current and past committee members
- Identify processes for onboarding new members
- Identify a process for offboarding members
- Include a process for recruiting and selecting new members
- Appoint a [core team member](https://carpentries.org/team/) liaison 
- Appoint an Executive Council liaison 
- Utilise The Carpentries [communication pathways](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/index.html) 

## Public Documentation
Each committee should have a public page with the following information:

- __Committee Name__  
- __Short Committee Description__

- __Names of individuals in other committee roles__
- __Executive Council Liaison__ 
- __Core Team Liaison__
- __Current committee members__  
- __Information for how to join the committee__
- __Past committee members__

## Internal Documentation  
The committee should also have an internal document for the committee members that includes:

- Link to onboarding information
- Link to offboarding information
- How the chair and other roles are selected
- Information on recruiting or selecting committee members: e.g. language, rubric

* These guidelines are __recommended__, not __required__.
