### Learner Certificates

We do not badge learners, but we do give them certificates of attendance if requested.

If you would like to give your learners certificates of participation following a workshop, please refer to [our certificates repo](https://github.com/carpentries/certification). This includes templates for the certificates and Python scripts to generate them.

We are developing an app to generate certificates.  To learn more, please contact us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org).
