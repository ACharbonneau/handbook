### Learner Certificates

We do not badge learners, but we do give them certificates of attendance if requested.

If you would like to give your learners certificates of participation following a workshop, please refer to [our certificates repo](https://github.com/carpentries/learner-certificates). This includes `svg` templates for the certificates and Python scripts to generate them.
