### Workshop checklists

#### Host checklist

After a workshop host contacts the Carpentries staff about running a workshop, he/she will will work with the Carpentries Program Manager and Workshop Administrator to:

* Decide on the Software Carpetnry or Data Carpentry curriculum that would best serve your learners
* Fill out the workshop request form
* Work with the Carpentries Program Manager and Workshop Administrator to set dates and location for your workshop
    * Be sure to account for other events and programs at your site that may affect room availability and participant availabilty
    * Ensure your location is [accessible](workshop_needs.html#accessibilty)
* Recruit helpers to join your workshop. They don't need to be directly connected with us. They do need basic knowledge of the tools we teach and enthusiasm to help other learn.
* Advertise your workshop. The Carpentries can help by managing an Eventbrite registration page.
* Decide if you want to charge a workshop fee. Even a small fee can greatly reduce the no-show rate. The Carpentries can collect this fee via Eventbrite and use it to offset your workshop fee.
