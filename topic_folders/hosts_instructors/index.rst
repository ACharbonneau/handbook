TEACHING AND HOSTING
=======================

Opportunities for certified instructors to teach Carpentries workshops are listed `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhTAzEalDqKUowgej7aRa7E1K0XcB6ZezoVUt6VN2qY/edit#gid=0>`_.  Join the `instructors mailing list <http://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors>`_ to be notified when new opportunities are posted.

Certified instructors are also encouraged to run workshops themselves. When organizing a workshop, you 
have two options: a centrally-organized or self-organized workshop. 

One way to understand the distinction between centrally-organized and self-organized workshops is who 
is responsible for certain key workshop components: 

| Component | Centrally-Organized | Self-Organized
|---------- |-------------------- |-------------- |
| Location  | The local organizer provides the space and organizes local logistics. | The local organizer provides the space and organizes local logistics. |
| Instructors/Helpers | The Carpentries organization finds instructors for the workshop; the local workshop organizer books the instructor's travel and finds local helpers to assist. | The workshop organizer finds both instructors and helpers. |
| Learners | The local organizer advertises and recruits learners, but the Carpentries manages registration, | The local organizer manages registration and advertising. |

In both cases, the host site is expected to pay for instructor travel (if needed) and
cover local costs.  For a centrally organized workshop, there is a fee if the organizer
is not already a Carpentries member.

Note that you are free to charge what you choose for a workshop;
this is a perennial topic of discussion among the Carpentries community and there's
a good summary of points here: [Carpentries Blog on Charging for Workshops](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/06/carpentries-workshops-fees/).

In both cases (self- or centrally-organized), you can start the workshop
process by completing the [Carpentries workshop request form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/) and 
then proceeding through the relevant checklists and list of tips below. 

For centrally organized workshops, the Regional Coordinator will guide the host and instructor(s) on following 
through on all these steps. A global team of Regional Coordinators support workshop activity and community building in regions around the world. `Read more <https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/>`_ about who they are and what they do.

For self organized workshops, the host and instructor are directly responsible for ensuring all the steps below are followed without support from the Regional Coordinator.
