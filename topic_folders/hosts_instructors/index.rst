TEACHING AND HOSTING
=======================

Opportunities for certified instructors to teach Carpentries workshops are listed `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhTAzEalDqKUowgej7aRa7E1K0XcB6ZezoVUt6VN2qY/edit#gid=0>`_.  Join the `instructors mailing list <http://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors>`_ to be notified when new opportunities are posted.

For centrally organized workshops, the Regional Coordinator will guide the host and instructor on following through on all these steps.

Certified instructors are also encouraged to run self organized workshops.  For self organized workshops, the host and instructor are directly responsible for ensuring all the steps below are followed without support from the Regional Coordinator.

A global team of Regional Coordinators support workshop activity and community building in regions around the world. `Read more <https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/>`_ about who they are and what they do.
