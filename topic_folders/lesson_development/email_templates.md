##### Curriculum Advisory Committee Invitation

Subject: Invitation to Join the {{carpentry org}} {{lesson title}} Curriculum Advisory Committee

Dear {{name}},

Thank you for your interest in being a member of the {{carpentry org}} {{lesson title}} Curriculum Advisory Committee! 
Because of your experience working with {{relevant data types}} and your perspective on and commitment to teaching {{lesson title}} data 
skills, we would like to invite you to be a member of this committee. We think you bring important and unique insight to what skills 
should be taught to {{lesson title}} researchers as well as how they should be taught. 

The {{carpentry org}} {{lesson title}} curriculum aims to teach the core skills and perspectives for working effectively and reproducibly 
with {{lesson title}} data. The role of the {{carpentry org}} {{lesson title}} Curriculum Advisory Committee is to provide the oversight, 
vision and leadership for the {{lesson title}} curriculum as a whole. 

This Committee will meet bi-annually to:

- Discuss curricular updates that have been proposed by Instructors, Maintainers or other community members.
- Provide recommendations for other potential updates based on current approaches in the field.
- Discuss proposals for new lesson ideas and provide recommendations about whether they should be developed or accepted and whether 
they should be incorporated into existing workshop curriculum or as standalone lessons.
- Provide a written report of the meeting regarding decisions around curriculum updates and recommendations.

Additionally Committee members are expected to:
- Be familiar with {{carpentry org}} {{lesson title}} lesson content and respond to content-related issues on individual lessons as needed. 
- Act as Maintainers for the ‘{{lesson title}} workshop’ repository, making sure it’s up to date with the overall goals of the workshops 
and correct links to curriculum and update as needed.

Prior to lesson release (currently on a 6 month schedule): 
- Review individual lessons to make sure curriculum-level learning objectives are being met by the set of lessons.
- Prepare the ‘{{lesson title}} workshop’ repository for release. Will be Editors for this repository at release.

Please let me know if you are still interested in serving on the {{lesson title}} Curriculum Advisory Committee and can commit to these 
responsibilities. If you have any questions before you can accept this role, please also let me know. 

Thanks so much. We look forward to the opportunity to work with you!

Best,
