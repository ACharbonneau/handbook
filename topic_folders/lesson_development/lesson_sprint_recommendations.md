## Lesson Sprint Recommendations

One way of making progress and encouraging collaboration on the development
of a lesson is to organise a dedicated event such as a co-working session
or a lesson development sprint.

Members of The Carpentries community collaborated to create
a set of recommendations for anyone planning to run such an event.
[These recommendations are presented as an appendix to The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/A4-sprint-recommendations.html).
