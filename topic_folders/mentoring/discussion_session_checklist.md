### Checklists - Instructor Discussion Sessions

This document contains checklists for the people involved in instructor discussion sessions.  The full procedure is described on [this page](procedure-discussion-session.md).  

Discussion sessions are organized and conducted through [this etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion)

#### Before the Discussion Session

1.  Invitations are tracked through two spreadsheets - one for instructors doing a [post-workshop debriefs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OZuaulmSVcekQcFlfWc6cK_8odm64pMqGnEMl3hSPHU/edit#gid=0), sent weekly, and one for instructors doing a [pre-workshop discussion session](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-R24LRURYx5-PjeW45vvZtPRI7LaQFg8tzixkkq49o/edit#gid=1948936411), sent every other week.

1. Use the [email templates](email_templates.html) for the respective discussion invitation. Replace the variables in brackets with the appropriate information for that session.

1. Log in to [AMY](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/account/login/?next=/workshops/log/).  Go to the reporting section and filter for instructors in the relevant time period. Download this list as csv.

1. Send the templated email to all participants as `bcc`, and copy the Mentoring Committee Chairs as well as `team@carpentries.org`.

1.  Email `team@carpentries.org` with any instructors with missing or invalid emails.


#### Leading the Discussion
- Sign on as close to the start time as you can.  
- Confirm that your fellow host is present (if there is one) and who will be leading/taking notes
- (Optional) If a group is very large and you have a co-host, you can split the group in two, using the Breakout Rooms feature in Zoom.  
- Copy the agenda from the bottom of the etherpad to the space under your time slot
- Lead the discussion
    - We recommend following the main points of the agenda, but feel free to let discussion go where people want.  Not all the questions need to be answered by everyone.  
    - Don't feel like *you* have to answer all the questions as the host - draw on the 
    other discussion participants to answer each other's questions.  
    - If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt them to ask a question. 
    - Try to leave enough time at the end for the final agenda item.  
- Take notes

#### After the discussion
- Archive the etherpad by clicking on the star in the top right corner.  
- **Fill out the [host questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/iXkMQABmO6HROfCy1)**
    - *Note:* Please copy the list of attendees (including all attendees but removing no-shows) and paste it into question 7 of the questionnaire. 
    - This questionnaire will automatically send an email to the mentoring co-chairs and to checkout@carpentries.org.
- Clear the information from your session (date/time, attendees, notes) from the etherpad. 
- (Optional) write a blog post about interesting points that came up in discussion; see 
[this template](template-blog-about-debriefing-session.md) as a starting point.
