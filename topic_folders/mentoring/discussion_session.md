### Discussion Sessions

#### Procedure - Instructor Discussion Session

This document describes how instructor discussion sessions are organized and conducted.  Checklists for the hosts and discussion organizer are [here](discussion_session_checklist.html).  

#### Terminology

-   **Instructor discussion session**: an online meeting where instructors share experiences from teaching and obtain information while preparing to teach.
-   **Host**: member of the Mentoring Subcommittee who facilitates a discussion session.

#### Motivation

1.  The Carpentries are community based projects and the community needs opportunity to interact.

2.  The Carpentries believe in jugyokenkyu, or "lesson study", and evidence-based education so instructors need opportunity to share experiences.

3. The Carpentries are continuing to increase the number of instructors and develop new lessons. New instructors would like to hear from experienced teachers who have recently taught to help prepare for upcoming workshops.

#### Who can host?

Hosting discussion sessions is a great way to meet more people in the Carpentries community, to get to know the organisation better, to learn from the experiences of others and to share your own knowledge and experience with an even greater number of people.

Any instructor with experience of organising/teaching workshops and a good knowledge of the Carpentries as an organisation is welcome to host a discussion session. Sessions are coordinated by the [Mentoring Subcommittee](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/scf-mentoring) and hosts are encouraged to join the meetings of this committee. Subcommittee meetings include an update on discussion sessions and an opportunity to discuss the format, to ask questions about hosting a session, and to get to know other hosts.

A great way to get into hosting these sessions is to first attend as an observer or co-host. An experienced host will be happy to talk you through it, and may return the favour when you host for the first time, so that you don't have to "fly solo" in your first session. 

#### Discussion Session Coordinator

A volunteer from the Mentoring Subcommittee acts as Discussion Session Coordinator. Responsibilities of the role include updating the scheduling etherpad and emailing invitations to instructors.

Further information about the role, including relevant checklists and email templates, can be found on the [Mentoring Subcommittee repository](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring/blob/master/roles/discussion-coordinators.md).
