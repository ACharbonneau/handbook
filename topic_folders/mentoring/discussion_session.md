### Discussion Sessions

#### Procedure - Instructor Discussion Session

This document describes how instructor discussion sessions are organized and conducted.  This information is summarized in checklists for the hosts and discussion organizer [here](checklists-discussion-sessions.md).  

#### Terminology

-   **Instructor discussion session**: an online meeting where instructors share experiences from teaching and obtain information while preparing to teach.
-   **Host**: member of the Mentoring Subcommittee who facilitates a discussion session.

#### Motivation

1.  The Carpentries are community based projects and the community needs opportunity to interact.

2.  The Carpentries believe in jugyokenkyu, or "lesson study", and evidence-based education so instructors need opportunity to share experiences.

3. The Carpentries are continuing to increase the number of instructors and develop new lessons. New instructors would like to hear from experienced teachers who have recently taught to help prepare for upcoming workshops.

#### Who can host?

Hosting discussion sessions is a great way to meet more people in the Carpentries community, to get to know the organisation better, to learn from the experiences of others and to share your own knowledge and experience with an even greater number of people.

Any instructor with experience of organising/teaching workshops and a good knowledge of the Carpentries as an organisation is welcome to host a discussion session. Sessions are coordinated by the [Mentoring Subcommittee](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/scf-mentoring) and hosts are encouraged to join the meetings of this committee. Subcommittee meetings include an update on discussion sessions and an opportunity to discuss the format, to ask questions about hosting a session, and to get to know other hosts.

A great way to get into hosting these sessions is to first attend as an observer or co-host. An experienced host will be happy to talk you through it, and may return the favour when you host for the first time, so that you don't have to "fly solo" in your first session. 

#### Before the meeting

The Mentoring Subcommittee is responsible for organizing the instructor discussion sessions so that

-   each month has at least eight discussion sessions,

-   instructors are notified at least one week in advance and

-   each session has at least one host (preferably two) to conduct the discussion.

Meeting scheduling will be coordinated via [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion).

The dates of instructor discussion sessions are also listed in the Carpentries [community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com).

#### Discussion Session Coordinator

A volunteer from the Mentoring Subcommittee acts as Discussion Session Coordinator. Responsibilities of the role include updating the scheduling etherpad and emailing invitations to instructors.

Further information about the role, including relevant checklists and email templates, can be found on the [Mentoring Subcommittee repository](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring/blob/master/roles/discussion-coordinators.md).

#### During the meeting

Meetings will be hosted on a Zoom chat, linked via the [instructor discussion etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion).

The agenda should be similar to the following:

- Welcome and host introduction
- Attendees introduction
    - Name, affiliation/position, purpose for attending
- Report from previous workshops
    - Share some significant accomplishments and obstacles.
    - Any changes or additions to lesson material?
- Preparing for upcoming workshops
    - Specific questions about teaching and/or lessons?
- Preparing for instructor training checkout
    - Questions about checkout procedure, lessons, or workshop organization?
    - Have you asked a question here yet?
- Closing
    - What are you most excited about for teaching Software or Data Carpentry?  
- Reminder to discussion session participants: 
    - For big problems or concerns, start an issue on GitHub in the appropriate lesson or add to Google Doc of commonly mentioned concerns
    - For small typos, submit pull request to appropriate lesson

(A copy of this agenda is kept at the bottom of the instructor discussion etherpad.)

Based on discussion among the mentoring committee, temporary questions may be added to the agenda for a month of sessions, in order to collect data on specific issues.  

Each instructor discussion session session must have at least one host (although two hosts are preferred). As mentioned above, any experienced instructor is welcome to host, but hosts are encouraged to join the mentoring subcommittee. 

The **host** is responsible for: 

- hosting the meeting and facilitating discussion using the agenda described above. 

- maintaining focus on the main goal of the session, which is to share ideas and keep instructors excited about teaching.

- ensuring instructors teaching in the near future have urgent questions or concerns addressed.

- collecting feedback from instructors who have recently taught.

- engaging newly trained instructors and evaluating their participation using a subset of 
questions described in the checkout procedure.

- encouraging attendees to create issues or pull requests to correct problems.

> If there are more than 5 workshops represented by attendees, the discussion session should be split into two groups, to make sure everyone has enough time to share.  When dividing attendees into two groups, try to balance the number of people who are de-briefing, who are there for pre-workshop help, and who are instructor trainees.  If there are exactly 5 workshops represented, it is at the discretion of the host whether to split the group.  


#### After Hosting the meeting

After the meeting, the host should fill out the short host questionnaire to provide feedback to the Mentoring Subcommittee and help the Carpentries administration to record attendance. Once this is done, the etherpad should be archived and deatils/notes from the session removed, leaving the etherpad clean for the next session.
