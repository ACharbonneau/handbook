### Setting up surveys

The Carpentries uses [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) to manage all workshop surveys. 
The instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K3X6lZqhJuRdc7sOj7InT7eNUTIUhGkgY3gvJJIHvrI/edit) are currently being migrated to this page.

#### Logging in

Workshop Administrators will have log in credentials from the Carpentries to set up surveys.  They will share links to view survey results with workshop hosts and instructors.

Contact team@carpentries with questions about logging in.
