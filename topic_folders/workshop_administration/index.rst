REGIONAL COORDINATORS
========================

Around the world, Carpentries workshops are organized by a team of Regional Coordinators.
Our staff Workshop and Logistics Manager manages workshops in most of the world. In some parts of the world, local Carpenters support managing local workshops and building local communities. They work with our member sites or as volunteers.

Regional Coordinators are the front face of The Carpentries, promoting our work and our culture in their geographical area. They manage workshop logistics, communicate with hosts and Instructors, and respond to general inquiries. The workshop administrators work together to support each other and ensure communities can thrive locally while maintaining quality and consistency globally.
