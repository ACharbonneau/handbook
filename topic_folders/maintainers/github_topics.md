## GitHub Topics for Lesson Repos

Across The Carpentries lesson programs, lesson repos are assigned [topics](https://github.blog/2017-01-31-introducing-topics/).  From GitHub:

> *Topics are labels that create subject-based connections between GitHub repositories and let you explore projects by type, technology, and more.*

Following a [maintainer discussion](https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/issues/5), The Carpentries has begun assigning topics to all lesson repositories.  An overview of how these topics are assigned is in [this Google document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ftV5L2C01aeHrMTWG0WWVm3MSeHMFZOEKw2a7ing138/edit#gid=0).
