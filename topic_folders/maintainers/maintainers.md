## Steps for Maintainer Onboarding process

1) Application to become a Maintainer is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PMzhri0CmbNkJiNor-nXDOP0d5jlAyp-VF-3df6cUf0/edit). Will need to create a new version or delete existing responses. Also need to change intro text.

2) Process so far has been to accept all applications from people who are at least somehow involved in the community. So far (1/26/18) there has only been one application that was not accepted.

3) After reviewing applications for any red flags, send accepted applicants invitation to become a Maintainer template email.

To set up a scheduling poll, use [WhenIsGood](http://whenisgood.net/). Click "Use Timezones" and then "SHOW OPTIONS".
Unselect Sunday and Saturday. Add Duration = 60 minutes. Select "hide dates".

4) Add Maintainers who are going through training to [maintainer-onboarding Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/carpentries.org/forum/#!forum/maintainer-onboarding). This is where announcements about upcoming meetings will be sent out.

5) After deadline has passed for responding to scheduling poll, select the two times that maximize attendance. This needs to be done manually from the whenisgood results, as there isn't a "choose two times" option.

6) Set up [Maintainer onboarding Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainer-onboarding) with meeting dates and times. Use [timeanddate meeting time announcer](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedform.html) links to make it easy for people to convert meeting times to their own time zone.

7) Send out an email to the Google Group letting everyone know about the scheduling. See template email (Maintainer Onboarding Meetings). 

8) Set up a new event in AMY with the name YEAR-MO-DA-maintainer-onboarding. Add all maintainer trainees as learners. Add onboarding leader as instructor. 

9) One week before the first onboarding meeting, send a reminder email to the Google Group. See template email (Reminder - Onboarding starts next week). 

10) Run the three weeks of meetings according to [the curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/). Keep record of who participates.

11) If people are not able to make all of the meetings, ask them to write out responses to the discussion questions and homeworks. See template email (Unable to attend Maintainer onboarding).

12) After the final onboarding meeting, do the following for each of the Maintainers who have completed the onboarding requirements:  
- Give them "write" access to their lesson repository on GitHub. 
- Add their name to the lesson table on the website.
- Award them a Maintainer badge in AMY.

13) Send email to the Maintainers email list announcing new Maintainers. See email template (Welcome New Maintainers).

14) Send an email to those who did not complete the requirements. See email template (Opportunities to complete Carpentry Maintainer onboarding).

15) Repeat step 11 as needed for those who complete requirements by email. 

15) Run sendmail_maintainer_certificates.R to send new Maintainers their certificates. (Note: need to add line in the email asking new Maintainers to add themselves to their repositories README.)
