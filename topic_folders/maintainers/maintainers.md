## Maintainer Guidelines

Carpentry Maintainers work with the community to make sure that lessons stay up-to-date, accurate, functional and cohesive. They monitor
their lesson repository, make sure that PRs and Issues are addressed in a timely manner, and participate in the lesson development cycle
including lesson releases. They endeavor to be welcoming and supportive of contributions from all members of the community. 

Maintainers are responsible for:
 - Routinely:
    - Ensuring reasonable response time to all submitted Issues and PRs. At a minimum, ensuring all Issues and PRs are acknowledged within two days.
    - Quickly addressing issues and PRs tagged as “bug”s. 
    - Submitting Issues as they arise.
    - Adhering to the Code of Conduct and alerting the Policy Subcommittee to any potential violations.
    - Identifying potential new Maintainers based on their review activity.

- Every six months: 
    - Participating in regular Issue Bonanza and Bug BBQ events, including organizing and tagging issues. 
    - Bringing in updates to the lesson template.

Maintainers represent the Carpentry community and should strive to embody the Carpentry philosophy, by:
- Recognizing the importance of communication and being welcoming to all contributors.
- Giving feedback to contributors using the Carpentries model:
- Find what’s good. Be specific about improvements needed. Use motivational language.
- Evaluating lesson contributions in light of Carpentries pedagogical model:
- Teach what’s most relevant and useful for learners.
- Avoid getting bogged down in technical details.
- Keep language motivating. 
- Emphasize the importance of continued learning and improvement.

Note: These guidelines are adapted from those currently in use by the Data Carpentry Genomics Maintainers and are provisional. The Maintainer team will be deciding on official guidelines for the full set of Software and Data Carpentry Maintainers. 


## Steps for Maintainer Onboarding process

1) Current application to become a Maintainer is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PMzhri0CmbNkJiNor-nXDOP0d5jlAyp-VF-3df6cUf0/edit). Create a new version or delete existing responses and change intro text for next round.

2) Process so far has been to accept all applications from people who are at least somehow involved in the community. So far (1/26/18) there has only been one application that was not accepted.

3) After reviewing applications for any red flags, send accepted applicants [invitation](email_templates.html#inviting-new-maintainers) to become a Maintainer.

To set up a scheduling poll, use [WhenIsGood](http://whenisgood.net/). Click "Use Timezones" and then "SHOW OPTIONS". Unselect Sunday and Saturday. Add Duration = 60 minutes. Select "hide dates".

4) Add Maintainers who are going through training to [maintainer-onboarding Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/carpentries.org/forum/#!forum/maintainer-onboarding). This is where announcements about upcoming meetings will be sent out.

5) After deadline has passed for responding to scheduling poll, select the two times that maximize attendance. This needs to be done manually from the whenisgood results, as there isn't a "choose two times" option.

6) Set up [Maintainer onboarding Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainer-onboarding) with meeting dates and times. Use [timeanddate meeting time announcer](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedform.html) links to make it easy for people to convert meeting times to their own time zone.

7) Send out an [email](email_templates.html#maintainer-onboarding-meetings) to the Google Group letting everyone know about the scheduling. 

8) Set up a [new event in AMY](../workshop_administration/amy_manual.html#adding-a-new-event) with the slug YEAR-MO-DA-maintainer-onboarding. Add all maintainer trainees as learners. Add onboarding leader as instructor. 

9) One week before the first onboarding meeting, send a reminder [email](email_templates.html#onboarding-reminder) to the Google Group. 

10) Run the three weeks of meetings according to [the curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/). Keep record of who participates.

11) If people are not able to make all of the meetings, [email](email_templates.html#missed-onboarding-meeting) them to ask them to write out responses to the discussion questions and homeworks. 

12) After the final onboarding meeting, do the following for each of the Maintainers who have completed the onboarding requirements:  
- Give them "write" access to their lesson repository on GitHub. 
- Add their name to the lesson table on the website.
- Award them a Maintainer badge in AMY.

13) Send [email](email_templates.html#welcoming-new-maintainers) to the Maintainers email list announcing new Maintainers.

14) Send an email to those who did not complete the requirements. See email template (Opportunities to complete Carpentry Maintainer onboarding).

15) Repeat step 11 as needed for those who complete requirements by email. 

15) Run sendmail_maintainer_certificates.R to send new Maintainers their certificates. (Note: need to add line in the email asking new Maintainers to add themselves to their repositories README.)
