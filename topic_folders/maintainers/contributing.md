## Contributing to Carpentries Lessons

Lesson Maintainers actively maintain all Carpentries lessons. However, contributions are always welcome by all community members. Novice contributors can read [this guide](https://github.com/dmgt/swc_github_flow/blob/master/for_novice_contributors.md#) developed by Carpentries Instructors.  It provides instructions for contributing to The Carpentries' lesson materials using graphical or command line interfaces with Git and GitHub. The [Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues) lists issues in need of attention and is a good place to find out where your contributions are most needed.
