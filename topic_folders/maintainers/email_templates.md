#### Community information for new Maintainer

Subject: Getting connected with the Maintainer community  

Hi {name},  

Thank you again for joining the Maintainer team! I am excited to have you on board and wanted to give you some information about how to get
connected up with the community. In addition to working directly with your lesson team, there are also opportunities to connect with and 
learn from the broader Maintainer team. Please sign up for our mailing list on TopicBox 
(https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers) and the maintainers channel on Slack (I have sent 
you an invitation). Those two channels are the primary communication channels for Maintainers and will be where you see announcements 
around technical changes, lesson releases, and other issues related to lesson maintenance. 

Please also "watch" the maintainer-RFCs GitHub repo (https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs) and your lesson repo, so that you can
keep up to date with issues and PRs in those repos. The maintainer-RFCs repo is where we hold discussion around issues relevant to the 
broad Maintainers community. 

Please also consider joining our monthly Maintainer community calls. You will find information about those meetings on our Etherpad 
(https://pad.carpentries.org/maintainers) and on the community calendar (https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events).

Please let me know what questions you have and welcome again to the team!

Best,
