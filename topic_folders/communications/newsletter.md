This information is intended for staff or community members that have taken on the responsibility of publishing the newsletter.

Each newsletter is a campaign on MailChimp.

To create a new issue, log in to MailChimp and click on *Campaigns*.  Make a copy of the latest newsletter and rename it to reflect the current date (e.g. `Carpentry Clippings, 27 March, 2018.`).

Check the *To* field as going to the number of newsletter subscribers.

Check the *From* field as coming from *The Carpentries*.

Select *Edit design* to add newsletter content. Highlight each box and click *Clear styles* if anything appears in bold when you don't want it to.

Add images by clicking on the *Image* icon in the edit window.  All images must be no more than 550px wide to render properly.

Go to *Preview and Test* to preview the newsletter before sending it out. This includes a desktop and mobile version preview.  Send a test email to yourself to preview in your email client.

*Save and Close* and schedule the newsletter to be sent.  This should always be for Tuesday at 9 am Eastern time.  A confirmation message saying "Rock On! Your campaign has been scheduled" will be displayed.

The newsletter will now be locked.  If any changes need to be made after it has been scheduled, you will need to pause the campaign, make changes, and restart the campaign.

The previous newsletter is then moved into the Carpentry Clippings folder which adds it to the online archive.
