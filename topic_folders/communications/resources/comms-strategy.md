## Background

### About us

The Carpentries is a volunteer-driven organisation committed to training and fostering an active, inclusive and diverse community that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research and libraries. Our community includes learners, instructors, maintainers, trainers, mentors, workshop organisers, paid employees and champions.

### Carpentries Mission

The Carpentries’ objective is to build capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research.

Our approach to attaining this objective is threefold:
- scaling evidence-based teaching, 
- creating inclusive environments, and
- building communities of practice based on open principles.

### Carpentries Vision

We envision a world where more people have the computational skills and perspectives to work with data to address their questions in science, scholarship and society. 


## Communications Objectives

  Our communications should articulate the purpose and value proposition of The Carpentries to facilitate uptake of our core offerings (i.e. workshops, trainings, and organisation memberships) among key audiences.

- Encourage participation and collaboration:<br>
  Our communications should emphasise our collaboration-driven ethos and point to the myriad of ways contributions and participation are encouraged in various Carpentries’ projects. 

-  Empower our community:<br>
  Our communications should amplify the voices and articulate the value of community members the world over, to foster a deep sense of belonging and ownership.
