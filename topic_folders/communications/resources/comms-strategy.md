## Background

### About us

The Carpentries is a volunteer-driven organisation committed to training and fostering an active, inclusive and diverse community that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research and libraries. Our community includes learners, instructors, maintainers, trainers, mentors, workshop organisers, paid employees and champions.

### Carpentries Mission

The Carpentries’ objective is to build capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research.

Our approach to attaining this objective is threefold:
- scaling evidence-based teaching, 
- creating inclusive environments, and
- building communities of practice based on open principles.

### Carpentries Vision

We envision a world where more people have the computational skills and perspectives to work with data to address their questions in science, scholarship and society. 


## Communications Objectives

To support the mission and vision of The Carpentries effectively, our communications should:

- Create awareness about our work:<br>
  Our communications should articulate the purpose and value proposition of The Carpentries to facilitate uptake of our core offerings (i.e. workshops, trainings, and organisation memberships) among key audiences.

- Encourage participation and collaboration:<br>
  Our communications should emphasise our collaboration-driven ethos and point to the myriad of ways contributions and participation are encouraged in various Carpentries’ projects. 

-  Empower our community:<br>
  Our communications should amplify the voices and articulate the value of community members the world over, to foster a deep sense of belonging and ownership. 

- Edify our community:<br>
  Our communications should strive to enlighten our community on pertinent issues by passing along information and discussing relevant trends on data, software, inclusive teaching, accessibility, etc 

## Meeting our Communications Objectives
  
In order to meet The Carpentries’ communications objectives, we have to carefully consider:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Language and tone of our communications</li>
<li>The Carpentries Brand</li>
<li>The Carpentries Audiences</li>
<li>The Carpentries Communication Platforms</li>
<li>Inclusivity in our Communications</li>
</ol>


<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<h3><li>Language and tone of our communications</li></h3>

The Carpentries has a collaboration-driven ethos. In our communications, this should translate to inclusive messaging in diverse formats over different channels and as much as possible, using contextualised language, with the ultimate goal of enabling participation.

Because we cater to a distributed community, both geographically and disciplinarily, we continue to employ multiple communication models at The Carpentries, namely:

- interactive (i.e. via Slack, email, TopicBox, Twitter),
- transactional (i.e. via Zoom calls, workshops, instructor training, GitHub),  
- linear/broadcast (i.e. via Twitter, our Newsletter and Facebook).

The language we adapt in our communications should embody our "***people first, access for all and openness***" values as an organisation.

Depending on the subject and context (i.e. audience) of our communications, the tone we use should be an amalgamation of several attributes, some of which are listed in the table below. The Carpentries badge spells out where on the scale the tone of our communications should fall at any given time.

The Carpentries messaging is primarily relayed via the following formats: <br><br>

- Text: <br>
We value accessibility and ensuring community members have access options to our content and programs. Therefore, we offer transcription of any recorded community discussions in addition to providing slide decks from those discussions. <br><br>

- Audio: <br>
Community Discussions that are recorded using Zoom include audio. To ensure content is accessible to as many community members as possible, audio recordings will be added to The Carpentries account on a podcast platform. <br><br>

- Video: <br>
As often as possible we record onboardings and other community events for dissemination to the community via [The Carpentries YouTube Channel](http://youtube.com/ the carpentries). To ensure  content is accessible to as many community members as possible, we require videos to be uploaded including closed captioning in the language the discussion was recorded in.<br>
