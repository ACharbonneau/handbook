# The Carpentries Communications Strategy Implementation Plan

## Introduction

---

### Purpose of this document

The purpose of this document is to outline a clear uptake and implementation plan for the communications strategy so The Carpentries project owners and community members can adopt it for use effectively.

### Target audience for this document

This document was originally written for [the core Carpentries team](http://carpentries.org/team), and has now been made available to our community. It is designed as a resource to be referenced regularly, rather than as literature to be studied once and archived after.


Our unique value as The Carpentries is that we have evolved over the last twenty years as a community-led organisation, spanning multiple cultural and disciplinary contexts, and working towards a unified goal - that of equipping researchers and librarians with foundational computational and data science skills. 

Propelled by a lean core team that exemplifies [holacractic](https://www.holacracy.org) practices and oversees the activities of thousands of people around the world, it is important for us to take on an innovative and proactive approach in all communication at The Carpentries because:
- our community is geographically distributed and rendezvouses primarily on the internet where most of our exchanges - deliberations, collaborations, strategising and empowering- happen.
- our community is a mashup of many stand-alone communities - learners, instructors, trainers, council members, committee members, et al. and with so many moving parts, communicating helps us all to stay on course and focussed on our collective goal as a community-led organisation.
- clarity, transparency and timeliness are essential in giving individual members a deep-seated sense of ownership and belonging, as well as in growing and sustaining The Carpentries.
