# The Carpentries Communications Strategy Implementation Plan

## Introduction

---

### Purpose of this document

The purpose of this document is to outline a clear uptake and implementation plan for the communications strategy so The Carpentries project owners and community members can adopt it for use effectively.

### Target audience for this document

This document was originally written for [the core Carpentries team](http://carpentries.org/team), and has now been made available to our community. It is designed as a resource to be referenced regularly, rather than as literature to be studied once and archived after.


Our unique value as The Carpentries is that we have evolved over the last twenty years as a community-led organisation, spanning multiple cultural and disciplinary contexts, and working towards a unified goal - that of equipping researchers and librarians with foundational computational and data science skills. 

Propelled by a lean core team that exemplifies [holacractic](https://www.holacracy.org) practices and oversees the activities of thousands of people around the world, it is important for us to take on an innovative and proactive approach in all communication at The Carpentries because:
- our community is geographically distributed and rendezvouses primarily on the internet where most of our exchanges - deliberations, collaborations, strategising and empowering- happen.
- our community is a mashup of many stand-alone communities - learners, instructors, trainers, council members, committee members, et al. and with so many moving parts, communicating helps us all to stay on course and focussed on our collective goal as a community-led organisation.
- clarity, transparency and timeliness are essential in giving individual members a deep-seated sense of ownership and belonging, as well as in growing and sustaining The Carpentries.


## Project-Centric Communications

--- 

For every project, a complete communications plan will be the sum total of four components:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>[A communications briefing](#communications-briefing)</li>
<li>[Audience mapping](#audience-mapping)</li>
<li>Outreach plan</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
</ol>

### Communications Briefing

The role of the Community Development team is to help align all of The Carpentries’ communications with our strategy, and empower our community by communicating effectively. To help The Carpentries’ Communications team review your project communications adequately, each project team will schedule an hour-long communications brainstorm session at the onset of their project to talk about Project particulars highlighted in orange. 
Highlighted in green are existing project details you will need to have before the Communications brainstorm meeting in order for us to collaboratively develop a wholesome communications plan.

### Audience Mapping

The audience of our communications activities is broadly comprised of researchers, scientists, librarians, and developers. However, given that transparency is a core tenet of The Carpentries, we have a broader audience comprised of partners, funders, and broader communities in academia, data science, and software that access and keep abreast with aspects of The Carpentries activities as and when we share them. 

[Using guides provided by Democrati.se](http://democrati.se/docs/Democratise.IdentifyingYourStakeholders.pdf), the Community Development team will work with different project teams to brainstorm on specific audiences our communications and outreach efforts should target for different projects. These audiences will then be added to our Carpentries audience mapping document which is currently a work in progress. 

We recommend scheduling time to carry out this hour-long brainstorming exercise with our team at least once in your project lifecycle, and preferably in the early stages.

### Outreach Plan

The Carpentries’ Asana Project Template currently holds an outreach plan checklist for every project to use. Ahead of any project-related announcement, remember to draft tweet-long messages to aid our Twitter and 1:1 outreach efforts, as well as long-form messages for TopicBox, Slack and our Newsletter.

We will also start attaching multimedia to key messages where possible, and welcome your suggestions on which ones would be best suited. Where none is provided, we will use tools like [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com) to generate images or short videos for use. In some cases, we will employ use of [The Carpentries badge and logo](https://github.com/carpentries/logo/blob/master/Badge_Carpentries_icon.png).


### Evaluation
The Carpentries values a culture of assessment and data-driven decision making. As such, this communications plan will be consistently evaluated and revised.

**Intent vs. Outcomes**

Projects lead by our team will include intended outcomes (what does success look like?) and actual outcomes. We realise that sometimes intended outcomes will not match actual outcomes due to feedback from the community or discrepancies in data collected during a project. Each project should include an evaluation plan that expresses the intent of the project, project outcomes, and data to support outcomes. Projects should include clear, consistent messages.
	
**Projected vs. Actual Metrics**

Projects should include specific metrics for engagement and interactions. Though the overall success of the project may not be determined by the expected vs. actual metrics, it is important to include goals for metrics when evaluating projects. Sample metrics include, but are not limited to:
- Social Media Impressions (Likes, Follows, Shares, Retweets)
- Number of New Sign-Ups for Community Discussions
- Number of Pull Requests and/or Issues on GitHub
- Number of Attendees at Community Discussions
- Number of Repository Forks
- Growth in Number of Workshops
- Number of Comments on Blog Posts

**Feedback**

The strategy around our messaging and communications will be reviewed consistently, and customised based on our target audiences. As this strategy is a dynamic document, it will be revised quarterly based on feedback from the Carpentries team and community.

Based on responses, questions, and engagement statistics on various platforms, we will particularly pay attention to the outcome of our messaging, i.e. 
- did we communicate impartially, with clarity, in a timely manner? 
- was our language inclusive, and our tone inviting? 
- did we cover all time zones adequately? 
- did our communication efforts break through our community silos? 
  - Did we encounter new contributions and interactions?
  - What new things did we try (video? podcast?)? Did it result in new memberships, training sign-ups? etc.
