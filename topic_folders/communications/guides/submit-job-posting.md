## Sharing Job Postings

The Carpentries has two main mechanisms by which to share community job postings: One is within our newsletter, [Carpentries Clippings](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/) and the other is our [#jobs channel on Slack](https://join.slack.com/share/zt-jw6ndhkl-rKyqtKGiBZnVtojOUDtgLw)

### Criteria for Posting
In order to ensure that job postings featured on Carpentries forums are applicable and of relevance to our community, The Carpentries Core Team has a list of criteria that a posting must meet in order to be shared. If the posting does not meet the criteria, then the post will be removed or modified after discussion with the poster.

#### Here are the criteria we consider when deciding whether to feature or approve a job posting:
- **Organisational Alignment with The Carpentries**
  - Does the organisation which is hiring have similar goals to The Carpentries?
  - Do our goals directly support each other?
- **Carpentries Code of Conduct**
  - Does the organisation abide by our Code of Conduct and/or have their own published Code of Conduct that has the same priorities as The Carpentries'
  - Note: If The Carpentries publishes a posting from an organisation and is then made aware by our community of incompatibility with our Code of Conduct, we will remove the posting
- **Quality of The Posting**
  - Does the posting bear relevance to our community?
  - Are the skills and experiences sought by the posting organisation compatible with the skills our community has or seeks to gain?
  - Does the posting mention The Carpentries by name?
- **Prior Knowledge/work with the Posting Organisation**
  - Often times, The Carpentries posts job opportunities from affiliate or member organisations.
  - If we have prior interactions and knowledge of the organisation, this is a strong indicator of a valuable opportunity post that our community will appreciate.

Note: These criteria are not strictly quantitative and rely on the judgment of the core team.

### Sharing Postings on Carpentries Clippings
Carpentries Clippings is a biweekly newsletter to members of our community featuring community news, program updates of note, and opportunities relevant to the wider Carpentries community.

In order to share a job posting that we will feature in Carpentries Clippings, please follow the [Sharing Relevant Announcements](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/guides/submit-news-item.html) guide.

### Sharing Job Postings on Slack
Once you have read the criteria above and joined the #jobs channel on The Carpentries Slack, you can share relevant announcements to the group. Please include the following information when posting:

- Job Title
- Organisation
- Location (if applicable)
- Posting/Application Deadline
- Link for more information and to apply

If a post does not contain the above or does not meet the criteria outlined earlier, then a member of The Carpentries Core Team will reach out to you via Slack DM to address the concerns and suggest modifications.

In cases where this process is not able to be carried out effectively (such as if the posting is by a spam bot), the Core Team will remove the posting, and with repeated instances of this, will potentially remove the account from the #jobs channel
