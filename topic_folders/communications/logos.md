### Carpentries logos

Many people ask about using our logos in presentations and elsewhere. If our logos are to be used, we want people to use
the correct versions of these, and to understand the conditions under which our logos can be used.

### Use of logos
 
 The names "The Carpentries", "Software Carpentry", and "Data Carpentry", and their associated logos are all 
 trademarked, and may only be used with our explicit prior permission.
 
We normally grant this to any training course that:

* covers our core topics</a>
* runs our standardised pre- and post-workshop assessment forms and provides us with the results
* sends us summary information about attendees (at a minimum, the number of people who attended).

You are also welcome to use our logos if you are referencing The Carpentries, or Software Carpentry, or Data Carpentry (or some combination of the three) in conference presentations.

If you are unsure about whether you are able to use the logo for a specific purpose, [please email us](mailto:team@carpentries.org) for permission.
