### Trainer Duties and Agreement

As of May 2017, the Trainers group adopted a Trainer Agreement outlining Trainer duties, and as of September 2019 a Trainer Alumni status was created for inactive Trainers. Only active Trainers are voting members of the Trainer community; however, Trainer Alumni are invited to participate in discussions and contribute to decision-making processes, and may choose to become active again at any time.  

##### Trainer Agreement

I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](../policies/code-of-conduct.md) (CoC) in all communications and interactions with The Carpentries community and to [promptly report any violations of the CoC](../policies/code-of-conduct.html#reporting-guidelines) that I become aware of.

I understand that the secondary learning outcomes of workshops are as important as their stated goals. I will:  
- Communicate The Carpentries community values to trainees and model that behaviour myself in how I teach  
- Provide a welcoming and supporting environment for trainees  
- Model our “show, don’t tell” policy in instructor training  
- Connect the principles used in The Carpentries workshops with other teaching contexts  

I understand that it is important to keep up to date and in touch with the Trainer community so that my teaching will reflect current practices and curriculum. Therefore, to be an active Trainer, I agree to:
- Teach at least two instructor training events per year  
- Host on average four teaching demonstrations per year  (1 per quarter)  
- Regularly attend [Trainer meetings](trainers_guide.html#trainer-meetings) when possible and read meeting minutes/notes when I am not able to attend  
- Read emails sent to the Trainer listserv  
- Keep up-to-date with the instructor training curriculum  
- Teach a curriculum that fulfills all of the current requirements for instructor certification  
- Provide feedback to other trainers and Carpentries Core Team about training events to help continue developing our offerings  

I understand that The Carpentries Core Team need an accurate understanding of Trainer availability in order to plan instructor training events. If at any point I am no longer able to serve as a Trainer, I will let The Carpentries Core Team know. I understand that only active Trainers are voting members of the Trainer community, but that I will be able to re-activate my Trainer status at any time by making arrangements with Core Team for re-onboarding. 

##### Trainer Alumni Status

Active Trainers may elect to become inactive by requesting Trainer Alumni status at any time by contacting team@carpentries.org. 

Trainer Alumni will not be permitted to:
- teach Carpentries Instructor Training workshops
- host teaching demonstrations
Exceptions may be made at the discretion of The Carpentries Core Team. To request permission to teach or host a demo, contact team@carpentries.org.

Trainer Alumni may select to:
- continue to receive Topicbox Instructor Training emails & participate in conversations
- continue to participate in the Slack private Trainers channel
- receive an annual newsletter during agreement renewal with community updates and details on how to return to Active status. 

A Trainer who wishes to return to Active status will have a different path depending on the amount of time they’ve been inactive:
- < 3 months no requirements - contact team@carpentries.org to request reinstatement
- 3-12 months: meet with Trainer Lead to catch up on latest news & discuss plans for re-activating
- >12 months: review Trainer Training curriculum, observe part of an Instructor Training workshop, and meet with Trainer Lead to catch up and discuss plans, including re-introduction to the Trainer community via meetings or other arrangements.
