### Joining a Training Event

When a site signs a new member contract or otherwise schedules a training event with the Carpentries, the Program Manager will contact the site to discuss instructor training.  This includes reviewing the [training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) and [certification process](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/).  

The Program Manager will share the [member training process](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/members/) and the current [member training calendar](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/) with the member site, and the site can choose the dates that work best for them.

The Program Manager will [share information](email_templates_admin.html#member-training-introductions) about the training with all participants, including a link to our application form and some pre-reading material.

### Host Checklist

Our training events are offered either in-person or using the Zoom videoconferencing platform.

## Online Events 

Online events are taught by two or more of our qualified Instructor Trainers using the Zoom videoconferencing tool. No log in is needed, but you may need to install a browser extension. Access to the training will be provided by the Administriation Team. All participants are required to have their own laptop and earbuds/headphones. Some participants may be attending the training in the same room. If this is the case, please be sure that everyone is wearing their earbuds/headphones and are muted at all times when not speaking.

You can read more about how to use Zoom [here](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/trainers_guide.html?highlight=zoom#zoom-manual-online-trainings).

## In-Person Events

In person events are taught by two insructor trainers traveling to the host's site to deliver an in-person Instructor Training event. 

* The Administration Team will introduce the Instructor Trainers to the host
* Work with Trainers to arrange any travel and accomodation needs
* Ensure your venue conforms to the [workshop and venue guidelines](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/workshop_needs.html#venue)

## All events 

Other things to be set up for the event include:
* Reminding participants of the pre-reading material that was shared by the Program Manager
* Reviewing the schedule to arrange for lunch and coffee breaks. Providing refreshments is suggested (people learn better with fuel!), but not mandatory.  A sample schedule is [here](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).
* Allowing for break out space during the event. The training includes partner and small group activities. If the room is big enough this can be done in different corners of the room.  Otherwise, a hallway alcove or nearby office may be a good fit.
