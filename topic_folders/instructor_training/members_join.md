### Joining a training event

When a site signs a new member contract or otherwise schedules a training event with the Carpentries, the Program Manager will contact the site to discuss instructor training.  This includes reviewing the [training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) and [certification process](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/).  

The Program Manager will share the [member training process](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/members/) and the current [member training calendar](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/) with the member site, and the site can choose the dates that work best for them.
