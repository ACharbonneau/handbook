Subject: Carpentries instructor training for [ site_name ]

Hi [ site contact name ],

I'm reviewing all our new Carpentries memberships and I see that [ site_name ] is about to join us as a member site. So I wanted to check in with you about online instructor training for your team -- one of the benefits offered to you as part of the membership package.

We have a calendar ready for online training events in [ date_range ].  

You can read more about the whole process here:  http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/partners/

and check out our training calendar here:  https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/

I'm excited to see you build a team of Carpentries instructors at %site_name% which will put you on track to running Carpentries workshops with onsite instructors. If you'd prefer to wait until [ next_time_frame ] for this training, I'll have a [ next_time_frame ] calendar ready in [ month ].  In any case, you'll have six slots available, and they must all attend the same event together.  

Let me know if you have questions about how all this works.  I'd be happy to answer any questions by email or set some time to talk by phone. Thanks -  I'm looking forward to get your team on board!

Best,

##### Member training introductions

Subject: Carpentries Instructor Training Introductions

Hello everyone,

Thank you for joining our upcoming instructor training session on  [ training_date ] with  [ site_names ]. As a reminder, this is a training for people who want to become instructors with Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry. The workshop is a mix of lectures and hands-on lessons where you practice giving a short lesson using approaches learned and implement some of the teaching techniques which we will discuss. This is training for teaching, not technical training; you do not need any particular technical background, and we will not be teaching that. This workshop is based on our constantly revised and updated curriculum (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).

This will be offered online with our instructor trainers, [ trainer1 ]  and [ trainer2 ]. You can read more about what you'll do these two days here: [ webpage ]

If you haven't already, you must complete our on line application form here (https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/) so we can officially record your participation and track your progress towards becoming a certified Carpentries instructor. Please use the group code [ group_code ]

Participants from each site should be in the same room. Individuals can not join remotely as our training includes partner and group activities. All individual participants should have wifi access.

Please plan to be present for the entire session both days. Participants who miss more than one hour will not pass our training requirements.

A videoconferencing link will be shared with the organizers/hosts at each site before the meeting. You should be in a room with a screen and projector as well as a speaker and microphone.  This link is for the room; individual participants do not need this information. We highly encourage the host sites test this connection in advance, in the same room using the same equipment that you'll be in for the training itself. Please contact me directly if you'd like to set a time to do so. We will start promptly on time; any time lost due to troubleshooting connection problems may count against your attendance.

*Some other things in order to prepare:*

1. Please read this short paper, which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching: "The Science of Learning" (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf)

2. Please go to the Software Carpentry lessons page (http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and the Data Carpentry lessons page (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), have a look at what we currently teach, and then choose *one* episode from the list at the bottom of this message and read through it carefully. You will be using your selected episode for several in-class exercises, so be sure you are comfortable with the content.

3. We will be recording one another teaching in pairs or threes during the class, so please bring a cell phone or hand-held camera that can record audio and video. It doesn't have to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand what someone is saying.

4. Please also bring a laptop powerful enough to teach on so that you can take part in all of the practical exercises (a tablet/Chromebook/etc won't be sufficient). No special setup on your own laptops is necessary.

Please note that after this course is over, you will be asked to do three short follow-up exercises online in order to finish qualifying as an instructor: the details are available at http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/. If you have any questions about the workshop, the reading material, or anything else, please get in touch.

*Episodes*

Please read through *one* of the episodes below carefully, so that you can do some exercises based on it on the first day of the class.

Please email me back if you have any questions about how this all works. Many of your questions will also likely be answered by your instructors during the training. Good luck with everything - we are excited to have you on board.

Instructors and hosts are CC:ed here if you'd like to get in touch with anyone. Participants are all bcc:ed.

Subject: New Carpentry Instructor Training Events Available

Hi [ name ], 

Thank you for applying to become an instructor with Software and Data Carpentry. We received many more applications than we expected and it has taken us some time to review applications. Thank you for your patience!

We are excited about your application and are looking forward to having you as a member of our instructor community. We’d like to invite you to participate in one of our upcoming instructor training events. 
                  
Please look at what events are available and register by adding your name to the registration form here: https://tinyurl.com/y8wcw94u.
                  
All listed events will be held online over video conference at the times listed. Please be sure to check the local start time before registering.

Because the group will be meeting by video conference, you will need a consistent and strong internet connection throughout the two-day event. All training participants do need to attend the entirety of the training event in order to become certified Software and Data Carpentry instructors. If you have any conflicts with this time, please let us know and we will try to find you a seat at a later training event.

Please register by [ register_date ] to let us know whether or not you will be able to attend. If we haven’t heard from you by that time, we will offer the seat to another applicant, however, you will still remain at the top of the applicant list and we will happily try to accommodate you at a later training.
                 
If you have any questions about the training, please let me know. We’re looking forward to having you as a Carpentry instructor!

In order to finish your certification, please finish these tasks (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/) by the 90-day deadline.

##### Reminder teaching demo

Subject: Software/Data Carpentry teaching demonstration

Hi,

According to http://pad.software-carpentry.org/teaching-demos you have signed up to give an online teaching demo on [ date ] at [ time ] (See this link for your local time: [ timeanddate.com link ]). I will be the Instructor Trainer running the session.

I wanted to make it very clear that I may give you any segment of the lesson you prepared to teach, so you must be ready to teach any part of your chosen lesson. Some people prepare to teach 5 minutes from a particular section and nothing else, and these often have to reschedule as they seldom are assigned the section they have prepared for. A lesson corresponds to a single line in the lesson tables (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ and http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) and a single repository on GitHub. Some lessons have supplementary modules, but you do not need to be prepared to teach the supplementary modules for your teaching demonstration.

For example, if you have chosen The Unix Shell, I may assign you any episode listed at http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/.

Please visit the Etherpad a little while before the demo starts, I will post a link there to another Etherpad we will be using for this demo.

See you at the demo session,

##### Recruiting new trainers

Subject: Opportunity to join Carpentries trainers community

Hi [ name ],

I wanted to get in touch with you about an opportunity to get involved with the Software and Data Carpentry community. Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC) are two programs of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initaitives). We are focused on spreading computational literacy to researchers around the world. We run intensive, hands-on, two-day workshops to help researchers and other professionals develop the fundamental computational skills they need to do their research. Together, we run over 300 workshops a year, and have reached more than 25,000 learners in 30 countries.

Our workshops are taught by volunteers who go through a two-day training program focused on pedagogy and cognitive psychology. These training events are run by our Instructor Trainers who also help to develop and maintain our instructor training curriculum. 

Carpentry Trainers are an eclectic group. Some of us have formal training in pedagogy, some are experienced Carpentry instructors, others run Carpentry-like trainings as part of their jobs. We all share a commitment to helping new instructors become familiar and comfortable with Carpentry teaching practices and principles.

If you’re interested in joining the Trainer community, please apply here (https://goo.gl/forms/yTx9yJzdWy6OAPtS2)! Applications for this round will be open until [application_deadline]. 

If you have any questions about the training process or the expectations for being a Trainer, please contact team@carpentries.org

To learn more about what we teach, check out our lessons here: (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and here: (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/).
More detailed information about what Trainers do can be found here: (https://github.com/carpentries/policies/blob/master/trainer-agreement.md).

Looking forward to seeing an application from you!

Best,
