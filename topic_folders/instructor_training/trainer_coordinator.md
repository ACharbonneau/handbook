Hi!

You’re signed up to host a Carpentries teaching demo within the next two weeks! 

Please double check your time/date link on the [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos) and confirm this one-hour time slot in your calendar. 

If you know in advance that you will have a conflict and are unable to host your demo, please email the Trainers list request a replacement. In most cases staff will fill in as needed if a replacement isn’t found.

If you have a last-minute conflict, please use Slack as well as email to request a replacement. You may use "@here" to get 
the attention of all online group members as well as tagging Karen Word and Erin Becker in your request on Slack. If you are 
unable to get help in time, please contact your trainees to [cancel](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/trainer_coordinator.html#teaching-demo-cancelled-trainees) or reschedule.

Instructions for hosting demos are [here](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/trainers_guide.html#running-a-teaching-demonstration). 
Please get in touch with questions, and enjoy your demo session!
