### Scheduling training events

The Program Manager collects availability from Instructor Trainers and generates a four month training calendar three times a year. 

| For the months of... | Trainers will be asked for their availability on... | Trainers will be asked to fill out their availability by….| A confirmed calendar will be released by…. |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------ | 
| Jan/Feb/Mar/Apr | early October | late October | early November | 
| May/June/July/Aug | mid February | early March | early April | 
| Sept/Oct/Nov/Dec | mid June | early July | early August |

The calendar is updated on the Member information page and on the internal Carpentry staff Zoom calendars.

Member sites are given the opportunity to join one of the posted training events according to these guidelines.  If no member site signs up for an event one month in advance, the Director of Instructor Training decides to convert this into an open training event or to cancel the event.

#### For Member Training Events

The Director of Memberships and the Business Administrator notify the Program Manager when new member sites are ready for instructor training. The Program Manager shares information about how instructor training works and the training calendar using [this email template](/instructor_training/trainers_guide.html#new-member-site-welcome).

Once a member site has chosen a training date, they must share a list of names and emails of participants with the Program Manager no more than three weeks before the event.  The Program Manager will email all participants, hosts, and trainers information about the training event using [this email template](/instructor_training/trainers_guide.html#member-training-introductions).  The Workshop Administrator will enter the training information in AMY, including assigning trainee applications to this event.

The Program Manager, Workshop Administrator, or Trainer will schedule a time for the site(s) to do a test run of Zoom.

#### For Open Training Events

Information coming soon.
